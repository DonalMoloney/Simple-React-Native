# Simple-React-Native

## React Native
React Native allows the building of mobile apps using only JavaScript; using the same design as React, allowing the creation of mobile UI with declarative components.


### The app itself

A very simple Hello World type app, to initiate my understanding of react-native. It shows hello world and depending on what type of phone you have says that one is better than the other.

## Technologies Used:

  - [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)


## Creating a React Project:

-Download npm
-Run command: npm install -g react-native-cli
- Create project: react-native init <project name>
- Connect and authorize your device, and then to view the app type in the command:
-- react-native run-android
